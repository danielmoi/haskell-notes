## Expressions
An expression is a piece of code that returns a value.

In Haskell, every function and expression must RETURN something.

## Defintiions
When a function doesn't take any parameters, it's called a DEFINITION (or a
NAME)

## Data Structures
- Lists
  - homogenous (stores elements of the same TYPE)
## Types
- `Int`
- `Float`
- `Double`
- `Char`
- `Bool`



## Type declaration


## Typeclass
- a typeclass is a sort of interface that defines some behaviour
- if "a type is part of a typeclass", this means:
  - "it supports and implements the behaviour the typeclass describes"
